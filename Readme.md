# Project Title
Demonstration of Django Rest Framework Implementation With React Integration Using Axios.

## Getting Started
### DRF
All the source code related to Django (Backend) logic is present inside the Django-REST-Framework directory. All the source code related React and its integration logic is present inside the React-DRF-axios directory.
It requires python interpreter,HTML5 Browser, Django Backend server, NodeJS.
* Open "Django-REST-Framework" directory first and create a virtual environment. Install necessary package over it.
* From "Django-REST-Framwork" directory using cmd/terminal run the server with the command "py .\drf\manage.py runserver".
* Open the browser following the url as "http://localhost:8000/".	
* If you want to change the port you can do by the running the server with the following command "py .\drf\manage.py runserver <any port number of your choice eg: 8090>" and follow the url in the browser as "http://localhost:8090/".

### React
* Install NodeJS globally, open the directory "React-DRF-axios" and install all the necessary dependencies
* The package.json file contains all the dependencies.
* From "React-DRF-axios" directory and using cmd/terminal run the server with the command "npm run start".
* Open the browser following the url as "http://localhost:3000/".	
* Make sure Django implementation of DRF is running at port 8000 as well.


### Prerequisites

* NodeJS
* Python 3.7x Interpreter
* Django, rest_framework, cors-headers, requests
* Axios
